# Arch Linux Configuration and Setup(s)
Repository for storing package lists and various config files for my Arch Linux setup(s)

## TODO 
- Modify package list to not include AUR repositories, pacman won't know what to do with these
- Upload desired config/dotfiles to have these available to pull to a new installation
